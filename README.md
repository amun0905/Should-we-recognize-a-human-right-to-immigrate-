This repository contains Amun Govil Lie's undergraduate essay in Political Philosophy, answering the question "Should we recognize a human right to immigrate?". 

The essay critically examines whether this right should be recognised, using three argumentative strategies outlined by David Miller:
- **Instrumental Strategy** - Immigration as instrumental to securing other fundamental rights (e.g., adequate standard of living).  
- **Cantilever Strategy** - Immigration rights as an extension of domestic freedom of movement.  
- **Direct Strategy** - Immigration grounded in basic human interests beyond existing rights.  

The essay concludes that the instrumental strategy provides the strongest case for more open borders but does not justify an unrestricted right to immigration.
